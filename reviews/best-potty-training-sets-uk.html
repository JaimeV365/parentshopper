# Article Introduction
intro:
  - "Potty training feels like one of those parenting milestones that everyone has an opinion about. After researching dozens of potty training sets and analysing hundreds of parent reviews, we've discovered that success often comes down to choosing the right equipment that matches your child's confidence level and your bathroom setup."
  - "The good news? The right potty training set can transform what many parents dread into a surprisingly smooth transition. We've identified what actually matters when transitioning from nappies to toilet independence."

# Our Story Section
our_story:
  title: "Our Story: The Reality of Potty Training Two Children"
  content:
    - "As parents of two, we learned that potty training success has less to do with timing and more to do with having the right tools. With our first child, we tried three different approaches before finding what worked - a simple toilet seat reducer that made them feel secure on the 'big toilet.'"
    - "The second time around, we knew exactly what to look for: something easy to clean (because accidents happen), stable enough to build confidence, and simple enough that our toddler could manage independently."
    - "The product we used with both children was remarkably straightforward - a basic toilet seat topper paired with a step stool. What made the difference wasn't fancy features or elaborate designs, but rather the practicality of being able to clean it quickly and the fact that our children immediately understood what to do."

# What We Learned - MUST HAVE 4 ITEMS FOR 2X2 GRID
learnings:
  title: "What We Learned: Key Insights from Researching Potty Training Sets"
  items:
    - title: "Simplicity often wins"
      description: "The most successful potty training experiences frequently involved the simplest products. Parents using basic toilet toppers reported less stress and quicker transitions than those with complex systems."
    - title: "Cleaning ease matters more than features"
      description: "Products that clean quickly with a simple wipe down get used more consistently. Elaborate designs with multiple parts often get abandoned when cleaning becomes tedious."
    - title: "Stability builds confidence faster"
      description: "Whether it's a non-slip base or sturdy construction, products that don't move or wobble help children overcome fear more quickly. This single factor appeared in virtually every positive review."
    - title: "Independence accelerates success"
      description: "Products that children can use without help - whether climbing a ladder or placing a seat themselves - consistently led to faster potty training completion."

# What to Avoid - MUST HAVE 3 ITEMS FOR BALANCED LAYOUT
what_to_avoid:
  - title: "❌ Buying based on cuteness rather than function"
    description: "Character-themed potties might seem appealing, but parents consistently report that simple, functional designs work better. Save the characters for reward stickers."
  - title: "❌ Choosing products that don't fit your toilet"
    description: "Always measure your toilet before purchasing, especially if you have a square or unusually shaped seat. Many parents waste money on incompatible products."
  - title: "❌ Overlooking portability needs"
    description: "If your child spends time at grandparents' houses or nursery, consider how portable your chosen solution is. Heavy, complex systems often stay unused in these situations."

# FAQ Section
faqs:
  - question: "At what age should we start potty training?"
    answers:
      - "Most children show readiness between 18-24 months, but every child is different. Look for signs like staying dry for longer periods, showing interest in the toilet, or expressing discomfort with dirty nappies. The right equipment can make starting easier whenever your child is ready."
  - question: "Do we need both a potty chair and toilet seat reducer?"
    answers:
      - "Not necessarily. Many families successfully potty train using only a toilet seat reducer with a step stool. However, some children benefit from starting with a standalone potty before transitioning to the toilet. Consider your child's confidence level and your bathroom setup."
  - question: "How do we clean potty training equipment?"
    answers:
      - "Most modern potty training products are designed for easy cleaning with soap and water or disinfectant wipes. Look for smooth surfaces without crevices where waste can hide. Products with removable parts often clean more thoroughly."
  - question: "Will a potty training ladder fit our toilet?"
    answers:
      - "Most ladder systems adjust to fit standard round and elongated toilets. However, square toilets or wall-mounted designs may not be compatible. Always check manufacturer specifications and measure your toilet before purchasing."
  - question: "Should we buy matching potties for different bathrooms?"
    answers:
      - "Consistency can help with potty training, but it's not essential to have identical equipment everywhere. Many parents find that one good quality set that can be moved as needed works better than multiple cheaper options."
