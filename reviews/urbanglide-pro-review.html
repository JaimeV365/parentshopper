                <div class="experience-section">
                    <h3>What We Love</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maneuverability:</strong> This pushchair glides through crowded city streets like a dream. The front wheels swivel perfectly, and it handles tight corners effortlessly.</li>
                        <li><strong>One-handed fold:</strong> After 8 months of daily use, the fold mechanism still works smoothly. I can fold it with one hand while holding my toddler with the other.</li>
                        <li><strong>Comfortable for child:</strong> My daughter (now 18 months) seems very comfortable. The seat has good padding and the recline positions work well for naps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build quality:</strong> Despite daily use, it still looks and feels solid. No squeaks, rattles, or loose parts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjustable handlebar:</strong> My husband (6'2") and I (5'4") can both push comfortably thanks to the adjustable handlebar.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="experience-section">
                    <h3>What We Don't Love</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tiny storage basket:</strong> This is our biggest frustration. The basket is so small that a standard changing bag doesn't fit. We often have to hang bags from the handlebar.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heavy when folded:</strong> At 8.2kg, it's not the lightest option. Lifting it in and out of the car boot gets tiring, especially with a toddler in your arms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Price:</strong> At ¬£299-¬£349, it's not cheap. You're paying for the brand and premium feel, but there are cheaper alternatives that work just as well.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wheels on rough terrain:</strong> While great on smooth surfaces, the wheels struggle on gravel paths or uneven ground. Not ideal for country walks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited accessories:</strong> The range of compatible accessories is limited compared to other brands.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="experience-section">
                    <h3>Real-World Scenarios</h3>
                    <p><strong>Daily city walks:</strong> Perfect. The maneuverability makes navigating busy streets and crowded shops a breeze.</p>
                    <p><strong>Public transport:</strong> Good. Folds easily for buses and trains, though the weight makes it awkward to carry up stairs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shopping:</strong> Frustrating. The small basket means you can't do a proper grocery shop without additional bags.</p>
                    <p><strong>Travel:</strong> Excellent. Folds compactly and fits in most car boots. The one-handed fold is a lifesaver at airports.</p>

                    <h3>Performance in Daily Use</h3>
                    <p>After 8 months of daily use, the UrbanGlide Pro has held up well. The frame shows no signs of wear, and all mechanisms still work smoothly. The fabric is easy to clean and hasn't faded or stained despite regular use.</p>
                    <p>The pushchair handles well in various weather conditions. The rain cover (sold separately) fits well and keeps our daughter dry. The sun canopy provides good coverage and is easy to adjust.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3>Build Quality</h3>
                    <p>The build quality is excellent. The frame feels solid and well-constructed. All joints and connections are tight, with no play or movement. The fabric is durable and the stitching is neat and strong.</p>
                    <p>We've had no issues with the wheels, brakes, or folding mechanism despite daily use. The pushchair still looks almost new, which is impressive given how much we use it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-section">
                    <h3>Value for Money</h3>
                    <p>At ¬£299-¬£349, the UrbanGlide Pro is expensive but not unreasonable for what you get. The build quality and features justify the price, though there are cheaper alternatives that offer similar functionality.</p>
                    <p>If you're looking for a premium city pushchair and budget isn't a major concern, it's worth the investment. However, if you're on a tight budget, there are better value options available.</p>

                    <h3>Is the UrbanGlide Pro worth the price?</h3>
                    <p>If you prioritize build quality and smooth operation, yes. However, there are cheaper alternatives that offer similar functionality. The CompactMax Travel is a better value option with comparable features.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does it handle rough terrain?</h3>
                    <p>Not great. The wheels are designed for smooth city surfaces. If you need something for country walks or rough terrain, look for a pushchair with larger, more robust wheels.</p>

                    <h3>Is the storage basket really that small?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, unfortunately. A standard changing bag won't fit, and you'll struggle with grocery shopping. This is the main drawback for many parents.</p>

                    <h3>How long will it last?</h3>
                    <p>Based on our 8 months of daily use, it should last for years. The build quality is excellent, and all components are holding up well.</p>

                    <h3>Is it suitable for newborns?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, with the appropriate newborn insert (sold separately). The seat reclines fully and has a 5-point harness suitable for newborns.</p>
