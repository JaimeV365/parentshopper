# Article Introduction
intro:
  - "Watching your baby fling sweet potato puree across the kitchen while simultaneously grinding toast into their hair makes you realise: choosing the right high chair isn't about Instagram aesthetics. It's about surviving the chaos of weaning with your sanity (and walls) intact."
  - "We've identified what actually matters when you're dealing with a squirming, food-throwing tiny human three times a day. The winner? A chair that cleans in seconds, grows with your child, and doesn't become another piece of clutter in your already cramped kitchen."

# Our Story Section
our_story:
  title: "Our Story: Multiple High Chairs, One Realisation"
  content:
    - "We started like many first-time parents: convinced we needed the 'perfect' high chair with all the features. We wanted something that would grow with our child, look good in our kitchen, and make mealtimes easier."
    - "Then reality hit. Our needs changed as we learned more about what we actually needed. The chair that looked perfect online became a nightmare to clean. The 'convertible' features we thought we'd use daily stayed unused."
    - "That's when we discovered the value of choosing based on daily practicality. The best high chair isn't the one with the most features—it's the one that makes your actual life easier, meal after meal, day after day."

      - name: "Storage"

    why_love: "The SmartClean isn't just another convertible high chair—it's the one chair that genuinely adapts to every stage. The swing-out tray feature alone saved countless back-aching moments trying to wrestle wriggly toddlers in and out."
    why_love_2: "The genius is in the details: the tray swings completely out of the way with one hand (crucial when you're holding a messy baby), and there's a hidden drawer underneath for storing bibs and spoons. The self-standing fold stores upright taking minimal floor space."
    pros:
      - "Swing-out tray mechanism - no lifting over baby's head"
      - "Hidden storage drawer - keeps utensils right where you need them"

      - "Self-standing fold - stores upright taking minimal floor space"
    cons:
      - "Assembly instructions could be clearer - budget 30 minutes"
      - "Fabric isn't as wipeable as pure plastic chairs - sauce stains need immediate attention"
      - "At 7.5kg, it's not the lightest option if constantly moving between rooms"

    verdict: "Sometimes the simplest solution is the best. The Antilop has achieved legendary status among UK parents for one reason: it just works"
    verdict_2: "Perfect for practical parents who value easy cleaning over features, anyone needing a second chair, or those with limited budgets who still want quality"
    link: "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08KQG7G8L?&linkCode=ll1&tag=parentshopper-21&linkId=cacd6bdc97cc0d03342a0d3dc55224f9&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"

        value: "Tool-free - legs click in"
      - name: "Storage"
        value: "Stackable design"
    why_love: "No fabric to stain, no crevices for food to hide, no complicated mechanisms to break. The entire chair (including the tray) can be dismantled and put in the dishwasher when things get really messy."
    why_love_2: "The wide base means no tipping concerns, and many parents buy a spare for grandparents' houses because at this price point, why not? It's the chair restaurants use worldwide for good reason."
    pros:
      - "Completely smooth surfaces - no fabric, padding, or gaps"
      - "Dishwasher-proof everything - even the straps come off for deep cleaning"
      - "Incredibly stable - wide base means no tipping concerns"
      - "Tool-free assembly - legs click in, done in 2 minutes"
      - "Stackable - restaurants use these for good reason"
    cons:
      - "No adjustability whatsoever - height, recline, or footrest"
      - "Tray can be stiff to remove initially (gets easier with use)"
      - "Some parents find the lack of padding uncomfortable for longer meals"
      - "The aesthetics are purely functional"

    rating: "★★★★★ (Premium Choice)"

    verdict_2: "Perfect for parents who value longevity and design, those with space for a permanent chair, families who eat together at the table regularly"
    link: "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B008JVRKY6?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=parentshopper-21&linkId=8f30b34f1ae6c6969fd10ba52eda06e6&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"

      - name: "Material"
        value: "FSC-certified solid beech wood"
      - name: "Design"
        value: "Table-level seating"
      - name: "Durability"
        value: "Lasts decades"
    why_love: "No tray needed (though available separately)—they're part of the dinner conversation from day one. The build quality is exceptional—solid beech wood that genuinely lasts decades."
    why_love_2: "The resale value remains strong, often 50-60% of retail price. The exceptional ergonomics provide proper posture support at every stage, and the design actually enhances your dining room rather than cluttering it."
    pros:
      - "Grows to adult size - adjustable seat and footrest accommodate any age"
      - "Exceptional ergonomics - proper posture support at every stage"
      - "FSC-certified wood - sustainable and incredibly durable"
      - "No plastic degradation - won't yellow or crack over time"

      - "No folding mechanism means permanent dining room real estate"
      - "Wood requires more careful cleaning than plastic"
      - "Significant upfront investment"

    image: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51N7NpnijxL._AC_SL1382_.jpg"
    alt: "Graco Snack N' Stow high chair showing compact fold and lightweight design"
    rating: "★★★★☆ (Best Compact)"
    price: "Budget-friendly option"
    verdict: "At just 5.4kg and folding to 15cm wide, the Snack N' Stow proves you don't need a massive high chair for proper mealtimes"
    verdict_2: "Perfect for small kitchens, grandparents needing occasional use, families who need to store the chair between meals"
    link: "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B081266ZV2?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=parentshopper-21&linkId=aa1bf0903a97a866a81d8e623b7d2883&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"

        value: "3 adjustable positions"
      - name: "Covers"
        value: "Removable and machine washable"
    why_love: "Parents in flats and small houses consistently praise how it tucks behind doors or beside fridges when folded. The surprise is the quality at this price point—the tray adjusts to three positions, the padding is comfortable, and the whole thing feels properly stable despite the lightweight build."
    why_love_2: "The ultra-slim fold means self-standing storage with no leaning required, and it's easy to carry one-handed. The full-size tray means no compromise on eating space, and the removable covers are machine washable at 40°C."
    pros:
      - "Ultra-slim fold - 15cm wide when closed"
      - "Self-standing storage - no leaning required"
      - "Lightweight - easy one-handed carrying"
      - "Full-size tray - no compromise on eating space"
      - "Removable covers - machine washable at 40°C"
    cons:
      - "Limited recline positions compared to pricier models"
      - "The legs do stick out quite far when open (trip hazard in tight spaces)"
      - "Some parents find the seat back angle too reclined for younger babies"

    alt: "Joie Mimzy Snacker high chair showing mid-range design with storage features"
    rating: "★★★★☆ (Good Value)"
    price: "Budget-friendly option"
    verdict: "The Mimzy Snacker hits the sweet spot between budget and premium, offering features usually found on more expensive chairs"
    verdict_2: "Perfect for parents wanting good features without premium prices, those who need regular folding but want comfort, families who appreciate clever storage solutions"
    link: "https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B084KRNBZD?&linkCode=ll1&tag=parentshopper-21&linkId=958fcc0018d533c22ef94a3ae51dceec&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"

        value: "Clips attach to rear legs"
      - name: "Footprint"
        value: "Compact design"
    why_love: "The one-handed fold (using a concealed strap) actually works, and the three recline positions accommodate sleepy post-meal babies. Parents particularly praise the tray storage on the back legs—genius for quick kitchen clean-ups."
    why_love_2: "The large storage basket underneath holds bibs, wipes, and the inevitable toy distraction arsenal. The dishwasher-safe tray comes with a proper cup holder, and despite the features, it has a smaller footprint than most full-feature chairs."
    pros:
      - "Hidden fold strap - accessible but child-proof"
      - "Tray storage clips - attaches to rear legs when not needed"
      - "3-position recline - accommodates tired babies"
      - "Dishwasher-safe tray - with proper cup holder"
      - "Compact footprint - smaller than most full-feature chairs"

      - "Heavier than ultra-compact models at 6.5kg"

# What We Learned
learnings:
  title: "What We Learned: Key Insights from Real-World Use"
  items:
    - title: "Easy Cleaning Matters Most"
      description: "The number one complaint about high chairs? Impossible-to-clean crevices. We prioritised smooth surfaces and removable parts. Chairs that take more than 2 minutes to wipe down after a meal become daily frustrations."
    - title: "Convertible Features Aren't Always Worth It"
      description: "Many 'grows with child' chairs are brilliant as high chairs but terrible as toddler seats. Don't pay extra for features you might never use—focus on what you need for the next 18 months."
    - title: "Storage Space Is More Important Than You Think"
      description: "UK homes are small. Bulky chairs that don't fold or store efficiently take up valuable space. If you need to store it daily, a complicated fold mechanism will drive you mad by week two."
    - title: "Your Baby's Needs Will Change"
      description: "What works for a 6-month-old starting solids becomes less effective for a 2-year-old who wants independence. Budget for one high chair that adapts well, or plan for a simpler option that you won't mind replacing as needs change."

# What to Avoid
what_to_avoid:
  - title: "Buying Based on Looks Alone"
    description: "That gorgeous wooden chair might be impossible to clean after a spaghetti explosion. Prioritise practical features over aesthetics."
  - title: "Assuming 'Grows with Child' Means Practical at Every Stage"
    description: "Some convertible chairs are brilliant as high chairs but terrible as toddler seats. Test the features you'll actually use, not the marketing claims."
  - title: "Forgetting the Tray Size"
    description: "Tiny trays mean more floor cleaning. Look for ones that properly contain the mess zone. The tray should be large enough to catch most of the chaos."

# FAQ Section
faqs:
  - question: "When should I start using a high chair?"
    answers:
      - "Most parents start around 6 months when baby can sit unassisted. Some chairs with recline functions work from 4 months, but the mess-containing benefits really begin with solid foods."
  - question: "Do I really need an expensive high chair?"
    answers:
      - "Absolutely not. The IKEA Antilop proves that a budget-friendly option can buy you years of reliable service. Premium chairs offer benefits like longevity and aesthetics, but aren't essential for safe, happy mealtimes."
  - question: "What's the most important feature to look for?"
    answers:
      - "Easy cleaning, without question. You'll clean it multiple times daily. If it takes more than 2 minutes to wipe down after a meal, you'll grow to hate it."
      - "Look for smooth surfaces, removable parts that go in the dishwasher, and no fabric or crevices where food can hide."
  - question: "Should I get one that converts to a regular chair?"
    answers:
      - "Only if you genuinely see yourself using that feature. Many parents find toddlers prefer regular chairs with cushions rather than converted high chairs. Don't pay extra for features you might never use."
  - question: "How long do children use high chairs?"
    answers:
      - "Typically until 2-3 years, though this varies enormously. Some 18-month-olds want 'big kid' chairs, while some 4-year-olds still prefer the security of their high chair."
      - "The best chairs adapt to your child's needs rather than forcing them into a specific timeline."
