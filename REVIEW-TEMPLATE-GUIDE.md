# ParentShopper Review Template System

## Overview

This system provides a **unified, consistent structure** for all review pages, eliminating the inconsistencies and manual maintenance issues we've been experiencing.

## How It Works

### 1. **Unified Layout** (`_layouts/review.html`)
- All review pages use the same layout
- Consistent CSS loading and structure
- Automatic header, footer, and navigation

### 2. **Modular Components** (`_includes/`)
- `review-components.html` - Quick Answer section
- `product-review.html` - Individual product reviews
- `review-template.html` - Complete review structure

### 3. **Data-Driven Content**
- Reviews are defined in YAML front matter
- No more manual HTML editing
- Consistent structure enforced automatically

## Creating a New Review

### Step 1: Create the review file
