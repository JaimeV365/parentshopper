                <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
                <p>ParentShopper is a free resource for parents, but we do earn money through affiliate partnerships. Here's exactly how it works:</p>
                
                <div class="disclosure-box">
                    <h3>Affiliate Commissions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We earn small commissions when you buy products through our links</li>
                        <li>This typically ranges from 3-8% of the purchase price</li>
                        <li>You pay exactly the same price whether you use our links or not</li>
                        <li>We never mark up prices or charge you extra</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>This affiliate income helps us continue researching products, maintaining this website, and providing free advice to parents. Without it, we couldn't offer this service.</p>

                        <p>We turn down many affiliate opportunities because we don't believe in the products. Our recommendations are based on research and testing, not commission potential.</p>
