                <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
                <p>ParentShopper is supported through affiliate marketing. This means we earn small commissions when you purchase products through links on our website.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This doesn't cost you anything extra. The price you pay is exactly the same whether you click our link or go directly to the retailer.</p>

                <h2>Our Affiliate Partners</h2>
                <p>We primarily work with Amazon Associates, as they offer the widest selection of products and competitive prices. When you see links to Amazon products, they are affiliate links.</p>
                
                <p>We may also work with other retailers when they offer better prices or exclusive products that we believe would benefit our readers.</p>

            <div class="disclosure-card">
                <h2>Our Commitment to Honesty</h2>
                <p>Our affiliate relationships <strong>never influence our recommendations</strong>. Here's how we maintain our independence:</p>
                
                <ul class="commitment-list">
                    <li><strong>We recommend products we genuinely believe in</strong> - regardless of commission rates</li>
                    <li><strong>We're honest about product limitations</strong> - even when it might hurt sales</li>
                    <li><strong>We don't accept payment for positive reviews</strong> - our opinions are genuinely ours</li>
                    <li><strong>We update our recommendations</strong> - when better products become available</li>
                    <li><strong>We disclose our affiliate relationships</strong> - transparency is important to us</li>
