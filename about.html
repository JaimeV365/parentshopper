                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>ParentShopper was born from a simple frustration: as parents ourselves, we were tired of wading through endless product reviews that felt more like marketing than honest advice. We needed a place where we could trust the recommendations and know they came from real parents who had actually used the products.</p>
                
                <p>After spending countless hours researching baby products for our own children, we realized we weren't alone. Every parent faces the same overwhelming decisions: Which pushchair will actually fit in our small car? What car seat is truly the safest? Which feeding products actually work?</p>
                
                <p>So we created ParentShopper - a place where busy parents can find honest recommendations without the marketing fluff.</p>

            <section class="about-section">
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We believe every parent deserves access to honest, helpful product advice that respects their time and budget. Our mission is to help busy parents make smart purchasing decisions through:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real parent experience:</strong> We share what we've learned from our own successes and mistakes</li>
                    <li><strong>Honest assessments:</strong> We tell you what works AND what doesn't - no sugar-coating</li>
                    <li><strong>Parent community insights:</strong> We listen to what other parents are saying about products</li>
                    <li><strong>Budget-conscious advice:</strong> We understand that parenting is expensive, so we help you find value</li>
                    <li><strong>Time-saving guidance:</strong> Get to the point quickly - we know you're busy</li>

                <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
                <p>We're just parents trying to help other parents avoid the mistakes we made and share the wins we discovered:</p>

                    <div class="research-step">
                        <h3>1. Real Parent Experience</h3>
                        <p>We share what we've learned from actually using products with our own children - the good, the bad, and the "why didn't we know this sooner?" moments.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="research-step">
                        <h3>2. Parent Community</h3>
                        <p>We listen to what other parents are saying - in online communities, forums, and real conversations. Parents are the best source of honest product feedback.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="research-step">
                        <h3>3. Safety First</h3>
                        <p>We always check that products meet current safety standards and look out for any recalls or safety concerns that parents should know about.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="research-step">
