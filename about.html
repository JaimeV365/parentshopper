            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>ParentShopper was born from a simple frustration: too many parenting product reviews that felt like marketing copy, not real parent experiences.</p>
            
            <p>As parents ourselves, we've been through the overwhelming process of choosing the right products for our children. We've bought things that seemed perfect in reviews but didn't work for our real-life situations. We've wasted money on products that promised everything but delivered little.</p>
            
            <p>That's why we created ParentShopper - to cut through the noise and give you honest, practical advice from parents who've actually used these products in real-world situations.</p>
